									in the summer, alongside her family, with only 2 waterbottles! Other than that, she
									has a deep interest in math as she is dabbling in competition math and hopes to
									explore math beyond high school boundaries. Also, you’ll find her coding in both C++ and
									HTML, in a coffee shop with an Iced Chai Tea with her navy blue converses,
									managing the WHS STEMist website. In addition, she’s always been willing to tutor
									and teach younger children, testing her teaching strategies for math on her younger
									sister all the time! </p>
